This is my branch of the w9wm window manager. 

Major changes:

* Windows can be "pinned", so they'll stay on every virtual desktop
* Alt-# key combos to switch virtual desktops
* Framework to quickly add additional keyboard shortcuts without having to hack in big ugly "if else" statements (see the keyCmds array in 9wm.c and functions in keys.c)
* "-winkey" command line switch to use the Windows key instead of Alt as your command modifier.

To view the man page, run this:

	nroff -man w9wm.man | less


BUILDING
==========

Make sure you have gcc and make installed. On a Debian-like system, you'll need at least libx11-dev and libxext-dev.

Run "make" to build.

You can copy the w9wm binary to your personal bin directory, or run "make install" to copy it to /usr/local/bin.

"make install.man" will copy the man page to /usr/local/share/man/man1; this is correct for Debian but may be wrong elsewhere.
