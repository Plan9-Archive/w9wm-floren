This is my branch of the w9wm window manager. Mostly I wanted to be able to "pin" windows so they persist. I also changed Alt-tab switching to Winkey-Tab switching, to avoid messing with other programs that may use the Alt key. I intend to make key combos fully configurable at some point and add combinations for switching desktops.

To view the man page, run this:

	nroff -man w9wm.man | less


BUILDING
==========

Make sure you have gcc and make installed. On a Debian-like system, you'll need at least libx11-dev and libxext-dev.
