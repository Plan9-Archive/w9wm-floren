This is my branch of the w9wm window manager. New features:

  * "pin" windows so they'll show up in every virtual desktop
  * Win-Tab and Win-Shift-Tab to switch through windows.

More coming when I feel like it.

BUILDING
==========

Make sure you have gcc and make installed. On a Debian-like system, you'll need at least libx11-dev and libxext-dev.
